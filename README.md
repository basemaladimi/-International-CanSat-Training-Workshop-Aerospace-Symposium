# üöÄ ICESCO International Model Satellite Workshop (CanSat Project) & Aerospace Symposium
This repository serves as my personal documentation of my participation in the ICESCO International Model Satellite Workshop, where I contributed to building and programming a CanSat (model satellite).
The workshop was organized by ICESCO in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and was supervised by Istanbul Technical University ‚Äì Space System Design and Testing Laboratory, led by Prof. Alim R√ºstem Aslan, Barƒ±≈ü Beynek, and Onur √ñztekin.

## üìñ About this experience
During this workshop, we worked in teams to:

  - Learn what a CanSat is and how it relates to CubeSat education.
  - Explore satellite subsystems (OBC, power, ADCS, payload, communication).
  - Get hands-on with ESP32 microcontrollers and Arduino IDE.
  - Connect and program sensors:
    - BMP180 (barometer ‚Äì pressure, altitude, temperature)
    - MPU6050 (accelerometer & gyroscope)
    - HMC5883L (magnetometer / compass)
    - GPS NEO-6M (position tracking)
  - Log data on SD cards.
  - Use a buzzer beacon for recovery after landing.
  - Build and test a ground station for receiving telemetry.
  - Integrate a camera (ESP32-CAM).
  - Assemble all components onto a prototype board.
  - Prepare mass budgets, flight readiness, and collect/analyze flight data.

## üõ∞Ô∏è What I Learned

As a participant, I learned:

  - How to wire and integrate multiple satellite subsystems.
  - How to program an ESP32 using Arduino IDE.
  - Basics of telemetry and ground station communication.
  - How to collect, store, and visualize sensor data from flight tests.
  - The importance of teamwork in satellite development.

## üì° Ground Station GUI

We developed an enhanced ground station interface named "SatRiders CanSat Ground Station" for the event. This GUI provides real-time telemetry visualization and mission control capabilities:
