# 🚀 ICESCO International Model Satellite Workshop (CanSat Project) & Aerospace Symposium
This repository serves as my personal documentation of my participation in the ICESCO International Model Satellite Workshop, where I contributed to building and programming a CanSat (model satellite).
The workshop was organized by ICESCO in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and was supervised by Istanbul Technical University – Space System Design and Testing Laboratory, led by Prof. Alim Rüstem Aslan, Barış Beynek, and Onur Öztekin.

## 📖 About this experience
During this workshop, we worked in teams to:

  - Learn what a CanSat is and how it relates to CubeSat education.
  - Explore satellite subsystems (OBC, power, ADCS, payload, communication).
  - Get hands-on with ESP32 microcontrollers and Arduino IDE.
  - Connect and program sensors:
    - BMP180 (barometer – pressure, altitude, temperature)
    - MPU6050 (accelerometer & gyroscope)
    - HMC5883L (magnetometer / compass)
    - GPS NEO-6M (position tracking)
  - Log data on SD cards.
  - Use a buzzer beacon for recovery after landing.
  - Build and test a ground station for receiving telemetry.
  - Integrate a camera (ESP32-CAM).
  - Assemble all components onto a prototype board.
  - Prepare mass budgets, flight readiness, and collect/analyze flight data.
